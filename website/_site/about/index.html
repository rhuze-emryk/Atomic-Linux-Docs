<p>Hello there! I’m Rich Hughes — father, beardless Linux greybeard, multipotentialite, problem solver, music obsessive, bad bowler, AI expert, and perpetual learner. I created this site to share what I’ve learned about Atomic Linux distributions in a way that’s actually helpful for humans.</p>

<h2 id="a-personal-note">A Personal Note</h2>

<p>I’m currently recovering from a neurological condition that has significantly affected my cognitive function and executive abilities. This has made even routine tasks challenging, but I’m determined to recover and continue contributing to the tech community.</p>

<p>To help cover my medical, recovery, and housing expenses during this critical period, I’ve started a fundraiser. The next three months involve several specialist appointments as I complete the final phase of a three-year journey to rebuild my cognitive capabilities. I’m very close to being back on my feet and regaining my “sea legs” after this long challenge.</p>

<p><strong>If you’ve found this site helpful or believe in what I’m building with my upcoming disability recovery platform, I’d be grateful for your support.</strong> Even small contributions make a meaningful difference during this challenging time.</p>
